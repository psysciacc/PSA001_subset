This R package provides a subset of the data and the analysis code for PSA001 project: To Which World Regions Does the Valence-Dominance Model of Social Perception Apply?

Over the last ten years, Oosterhof and Todorov’s valence-dominance model has emerged as the most prominent account of how people evaluate faces on social dimensions. In this model, two dimensions (valence and dominance) underpin social judgments of faces. To which world regions this model applies is a critical, yet unanswered, question. We address this question by replicating Oosterhof and Todorov’s methodology across multiple world regions.
